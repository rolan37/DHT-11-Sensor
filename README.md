# DHT-11-Sensor
DHT sensor interfaced with Arduino

I have simplified the steps of interfacing the DHT11 sensor with Arduino Uno. 
The DHT11 sensor is made of two major parts, i.e. the capacitive humidity sensor and the thermistor. The analog to digital conversion is done by a circuit inside the sensor.
The DHT sensor series can be interfaced with most microcontrollers.
